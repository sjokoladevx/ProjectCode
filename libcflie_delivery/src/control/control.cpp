            The above code show a simple example on get the velocity infomarion of the hand
            
            You need to find headers in the Leap folder, see what function you can call to 
            examine the hand's parameter

            My personal solution use the orientation of hand to compuate the get pitch and roll
            use the position of hand to get the thrust
            Use a "swipe" gesture to enable/disable the hover mode 

            you should also send out the signals in this function:

            if velocity.x > some value
              set current state to hover
            end

            if direction.x > some value
              set the pitch with some value
            end

            This function send out signal by set the current_signal variable

            This function should only send one signal each time, and only send signals when the last signal has been processed

            Recall that after the commander thread will set the current_signal back to NO_SIG, so we will only send out signal if we find this variable is equal to NO_SIG

            You may use lock to lock the global variable you use to synchronize the two thread
